# Getting started

1. Click `Install` on the **[Continue extension in the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue)**

2. This will open the Continue extension page in VS Code, where you will need to click `Install` again

3. Once you do this, you will see a message in the bottom right hand corner of VS Code that says `Setting up Continue extension...`. After 30-90 seconds, the Continue extension will then open up:
